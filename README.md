# Juicy Switch :electric_plug::tangerine:
A **RESTful** power **switch**.
The Juicy Switch enables you to turn a 230VAC device **on** and **off** using **HTTP**. E.g. you can switch a :bulb: on by calling `http://juicy.local/on`
and turn it off with `http://juicy.local/off`.

## :warning: Disclaimer :zap:
Mains can kill or severly injure people! Please read about electrical saftey first.
We designed the PCB to the best of our knowledge to be safe (see [Safety](#safety) and [Enclosure](#enclosure)), however **use it at your own risk**, we are no electrical engineers!

## Design goals
- DIY (do it yourself) :hammer:
- Affordable :dollar:
- Easy to setup and to use (your mom can use it :wink:)
- Simple yet powerful :rocket:
