# Juicy Switch :electric_plug::tangerine:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juicyiot/juicy-switch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juicyiot/juicy-switch)

A **RESTful** power **switch**.
The Juicy Switch enables you to turn a 230VAC device **on** and **off** using **HTTP**. E.g. you can switch a :bulb: on by calling `http://juicy.local/on`
and turn it off with `http://juicy.local/off`.

## :warning: Disclaimer :zap:
Mains can kill or severly injure people! Please read about electrical saftey first.
We designed the PCB to the best of our knowledge to be safe (see [Safety](hardware/README.md#safety) and [Enclosure](hardware/Readme.md#enclosure)), however **use it at your own risk**, we are no electrical engineers!

## Design goals
- DIY (do it yourself) :hammer:
- Affordable :dollar:
- Easy to setup and to use (your mom can use it :wink:)
- Simple yet powerful :rocket:

The Juicy Switch can be self assembled and is affordable, see [Bill of Materials](hardware/README.md#bill-of-materials). The setup is a friction less and quick process. After the device is powered up, it will create a WIFI hotspot called `juicy_switch`. Connect with your Smartphone/Notebook and proceed with the one time [Setup](firmware/README.md#setup). Eventhough the switch is very simple to use, many *smart* use cases can be built on top, see [Use Case Ideas](#use-case-ideas) to get inspired.
